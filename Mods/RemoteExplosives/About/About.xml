&lt;size=20&gt;Description&lt;/size&gt;
An assortment of remotely detonated explosives for different purposes- from defending your base to mining, and much more.
Also includes several new researches and a workbench to manufacture your explosive goodies.

&lt;size=20&gt;How to use&lt;/size&gt;
Everything you might want to build is available from the Explosives category in the Build menu. You can manufacture your own explosives, or buy them from traders- but at the very least the "Remote Detonator" research must be completed. With that, you can build the Explosives Workshop and the Remote Detonator.
Make the explosive of your choice at the workshop, place it using the Build menu, make sure it's armed, then trigger it using the Remote Detonator. Multiple explosives can be triggered together.

- If you research "Remote Explosives Channels" and upgrade your detonator, you can divide your placed explosives into groups, to be triggered separately.
- The "Auto replace" toggle on the placed explosives allows your colonists to replace them after they are triggered.
- The other research projects unlock the creation of different explosives- for mining, mechanoid defense, and other purposes. Read the research and item descriptions to learn more.
